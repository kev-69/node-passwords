# Argon2: Algorithm & How It Works
Argon2 is a key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm. It does not "encrypt and decrypt" passwords but instead hashes passwords securely.

## 1. What Algorithm Does Argon2 Use?
Argon2 is based on the "memory-hard" hash function principle. It uses:

Blake2b hash function for cryptographic security.

Parallel processing for faster computation.

Memory-hard computations to make brute-force attacks harder.

Salt and secret keys to prevent rainbow table attacks.

## 2. How Argon2 Works
Argon2 follows these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Preparation
The user's password is combined with a random salt.

Optional parameters:

Memory cost (how much RAM it should use).

Time cost (number of iterations).

Parallelism (number of CPU threads used).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Memory-Intensive Processing
Argon2 creates blocks of memory filled with pseudo-random data.

It repeatedly mixes data using the Blake2b hash function.

The process is highly parallelized (uses multiple CPU cores).

A large amount of memory is required, making GPU/ASIC attacks difficult.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Hash Generation
After several iterations, Argon2 derives a final hash.

This hash is stored in the database along with the salt.

The stored format:
```bash
$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$<salt>$<hash>
```

## 3. Why is Argon2 Secure?
‚úÖ Memory-Hard
Requires a lot of RAM, making brute-force attacks expensive.

‚úÖ Resistant to GPU/ASIC Attacks
Designed to be inefficient on specialized hardware like GPUs.

‚úÖ Parallel Computation
Uses multiple CPU cores, speeding up legitimate processing while slowing down attacks.

‚úÖ Prevents Rainbow Table Attacks
Uses a random salt, ensuring each hash is unique.

## 4. Argon2 Variants
Variant	Best Use Case	Features
Argon2i	General password hashing	Resistant to side-channel attacks
Argon2d	Cryptocurrency & secure storage	Resistant to GPU attacks
Argon2id (Recommended)	Best for password hashing	Hybrid of Argon2i & Argon2d (Most secure)
üëâ Use Argon2id for password hashing in authentication systems.

## 5. Is Argon2 the Best for Password Hashing?
‚úÖ Yes, Argon2id is currently the best password hashing algorithm because:

More secure than bcrypt & PBKDF2.

Protects against brute-force & GPU attacks.

Future-proof cryptographic design.
